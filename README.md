## :small_blue_diamond:Installation

#### RTBuilder release package :package:

The preferred way to install RTBuilder is to download the latest release package available on GitHub.  
Be sure to download the right platform version as your LuaRT installation, either `x86` or `x64`
Just unpack the downloaded archive and extract its content in the folder of your choice.

#### Running RTBuilder using LuaRT interpreter

RTBuilder release package provides a compiled LuaRT executable that embeds all dependencies (you can use it as a standalone app, on a USB key,...)
If you want to modify or extend RTBuilder, you can use the `RTBuilder.wlua` script to launch it with the `wluart.exe` interpreter.

## :small_blue_diamond:Documentation
  
RTBuilder should be easy to use :
- Put the desired widgets on the Window, move, resize, and set properties as needed.
- Save the Window as a Lua file using the `Window\Save` menu command
- To make the saved Window available in your Lua scripts, just `require()` for it, and it will return a `Window` LuaRT object ready to use.
- For more information on the LuaRT **ui** module, read the [ui module documentation](http://www.luart.org/doc/ui/index.html)
